//! Manage fine-tuning jobs to tailor a model to your specific training data.
//!
//! Fine-tuning lets you get more out of the models available through the API by providing:
//! - Higher quality results than prompt design.
//! - Ability to train on more examples than can fit in a prompt.
//! - Token savings due to shorter prompts.
//! - Lower latency requests.
//!
//! GPT-3 has been pre-trained on a vast amount of text from the open internet.
//! When given a prompt with just a few examples, it can often intuit what task you are trying to perform and generate a plausible completion.
//! This is often called "few-shot learning."
//!
//! Fine-tuning improves on few-shot learning by training on many more examples than can fit in the prompt,
//! letting you achieve better results on a wide number of tasks.
//! Once a model has been fine-tuned, you won't need to provide examples in the prompt anymore.
//! This saves costs and enables lower-latency requests.
